%%% GIVEN
% LTI system impulse reponse
h_t = (1/(r*c))*exp(-t/(r*c));
h_t = h_t*heaviside(t); % mutliply by step function because its causal!
% autocorrelation of intput signal
Rx_t = exp(-b*abs(t));

% find PSD of output and autocorrelation of output, and power of output
% process

% power spectral density of input
sx_f = fourier(Rx_t,t,w)

% PSD of output Sy(f) = abs(H(f))^2  *  Sx(f)
H_f = fourier(h_t, t, w)
