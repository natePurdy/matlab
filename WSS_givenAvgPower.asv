% given a WSS random process's average power
avgPower_X_t = 1;
% theta is a random variable with uniform distribution [0,2*pi]
theta_t = 1/(2*pi); % for 0 < theta < 2*pi
% X_t and theta_t are independent ie E[X*theta] = 0
E_X_theta = 0;
% a) find E[(x(t))^2] (given since average power = expected power)



% Compute inverse Fourier transform
x_t = ifourier(avgPower_X_t, f, t);  % using symbolic ifourier
disp('Inverse Fourier Transform of 1:')
disp(x_t)

% b) find E[cos(2*pi*f*t+theta)]
